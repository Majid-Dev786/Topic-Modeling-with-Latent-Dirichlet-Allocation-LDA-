# Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

This Python project demonstrates the implementation of Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with the `gensim` library. 
It's designed to showcase how LDA can be utilized to discover the underlying topics within a collection of documents.

## Description

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular technique in natural language processing and machine learning for extracting hidden topics from a large volume of text. 
This project uses the `gensim` library alongside `nltk` for preprocessing text data, removing stopwords, and constructing a model that can identify the main topics across the given documents.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Majid-Dev786/Topic-Modeling-with-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-LDA-.git
```

Ensure you have Python installed and proceed to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install gensim nltk
```

## Usage

To run the Topic Modeling with LDA, navigate to the project directory and execute the Python script:

```bash
python "Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).py"
```

The script will preprocess the provided documents, train the LDA model, and display the discovered topics along with their top words.

## Features

- Text preprocessing including stopword removal.
- Building a dictionary and corpus from the processed text.
- Training an LDA model to identify topics within documents.
- Displaying the top words associated with each topic.
